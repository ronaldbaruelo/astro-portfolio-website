This website application was my project on my Assestment on Cloud Engineer to showcase my skills on Docker and Azure Container.
### Key Technologies
- **Front End:** .Net
- **Container:** Docker and Azure Container.

This project showcases my ability to integrate various technologies to build a complete and functional application using Docker and Azure Container.

### Docker Installation and Project Setup

1.  **Create Azure Container Registry**: Go to the Azure Dashboard, search for "Container Registry", and create a new one. Enter the required information on the "Basic" tab. You can skip Networking, Encryption, and Tags, leaving them at their default values, then click "Review and Create".
2.  **Install Docker**: Go to the Docker website and download Docker Desktop.

### Dockerfile Creation with .NET

1.  Create a project directory and run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    dotnet new mvc -n HelloWebApp
    ```
2.  Run the .NET project to test it:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
3.  Copy the `localhost` link provided and paste it into your browser.
4.  Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root of your project directory with the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use .NET 7.0 runtime
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["HelloWebApp/HelloWebApp.csproj", "HelloWebApp/"]
RUN dotnet restore "HelloWebApp/HelloWebApp.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/HelloWebApp"
RUN dotnet build "HelloWebApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "HelloWebApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish /p:UseAppHost=false

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "HelloWebApp.dll"]
```

### Image Build and Verification

1.  Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t hellowebapp .
    ```
2.  Run the container to verify it works:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:80 hellowebapp
    ```

### Push to Azure Container Registry

1.  Log in to your Azure Container Registry. You can find the credentials under "Access keys" in the Azure portal.
    ```bash
    docker login ronaldbarueloregistry.azurecr.io --username ronaldbarueloregistry --password <your-password>
    ```
2.  Tag the Docker image for your registry:
    ```bash
    docker tag hellowebapp ronaldbarueloregistry.azurecr.io/ronaldbaruelo/hellowebapp:latest
    ```
3.  Push the image to the Azure Container Registry:
    ```bash
    docker push ronaldbarueloregistry.azurecr.io/ronaldbaruelo/hellowebapp:latest
    ```
